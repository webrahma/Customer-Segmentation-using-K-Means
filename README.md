# 🧠 Customer Segmentation Project

## 👑 Project Name

**Smart Customer Segmentation using Machine Learning**

---

## 📌 Description

This project focuses on analyzing customer data and segmenting customers into meaningful groups using Machine Learning techniques. The goal is to understand customer behavior, identify the most influential features, and divide customers into **5 distinct segments** to help businesses make better marketing and decision strategies.

The project includes full data preprocessing, data visualization, feature analysis, clustering, and deployment using **Streamlit** for an interactive user interface.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

The project was implemented through the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values
   * Feature selection
   * Feature scaling using StandardScaler

2. **Data Visualization**

   * Exploring customer behavior using visual plots
   * Understanding feature distributions and relationships

3. **Feature Analysis**

   * Identifying the most impactful features affecting customer segmentation

4. **Customer Segmentation (Clustering)**

   * Applied K-Means clustering
   * Divided customers into **5 groups (segments)**

5. **Model Saving**

   * Saved the trained K-Means model and scaler using `joblib`

6. **Deployment**

   * Built an interactive web app using **Streamlit**
   * Users can input customer data and predict the customer segment

## 🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Scikit-learn
* Joblib
* Streamlit

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 🎯 Output

* Customers are classified into **5 different segments**
* Each segment represents customers with similar behaviors and characteristics
* The Streamlit app provides real-time predictions
